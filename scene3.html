            <h1>Netflix Originals Quality & Quantity: Have Netflix Originals become more 'average' in quality over time, despite greater numbers of releases?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10">From the previous scene, we looked at changes in the quantity of 'good' Netflix Originals productions over the years.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10">You might have observed that over time, more variety in the genres represented were seen. Documentaries have always been most prevalent, but by 2021, more highly rated dramas were produced than documentaries.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10">However, can we say that the Netflix Originals are getting better over time overall?
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"> Below, the color of the point represents a three category rating of its IMDB score. Green observations represent 'good' (IMDB Score greater than or equal to 7.0) productions, orange observations are 'average (IMDB Score between 5.0 and 7.0), and red observations are 'bad' (IMDB Score less than 5.0) productions.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10">We can use the following chart to investigate individual productions to understand outliers while also gaining an appreciation for more general behavior with the adjacent violin plot. The Y-axis represents the IMDB score, and the X-axis is the year the Netflix Original premiered.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10">The color of the point represents a three category rating of it's IMDB score, where we consider a 'poor' movie to have an IMDB rating less than 5, an average quality movie to be between 5 and 7, and a good movie to have above a 7 IMDB rating.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30">Try hovering over each observation to see details about the particular production, including the genre, language, and runtime. By looking at the distributions from the violin plots, do you believe 2019 or 2021 was a better year for Netflix Originals based on IMDB score?
