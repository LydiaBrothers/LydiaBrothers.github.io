                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> From the previous scene, we looked at changes in the amount of production of Netflix Originals shows over the years.

                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span> We can use the following chart to investigate individual movies to understand outliers while also gaining an appreciation for more general behavior with the violin plot aspect.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span> The color of the point represents a three category rating of it's IMDB score, where we consider a 'poor' movie to have an IMDB rating less than 5, an average quality movie to be between 5 and 7, and a good movie to have above a 7 IMDB rating.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-up"/></span> Try doing x.
